#RESTaurant!

---
This is a restaurant app that allows employees to manage parties and orders. Employees will be able to 
- add/edit food items on the menu 
- select a party of diners
- select and delete food items the customers have ordered
- indicate that the party has paid
- print a receipt


Upon opening the application, the Home Page will say "RESTaurant App" at the top. Underneath that, you will have the option to "See the Menu" or "Add a Party"

******** WHEN YOU SELECT "See Our Menu" ********

When you select, "See Our Menu" you will be directed to the menu page, where all of the food items are clickable. 

If you click on the food item, it will open up a page with more details about that item (i.e. price, description). 

From this page, you will also be able to click a link to edit a food item (i.e. change the name of the item, type of cuisine, price, description, allergens). Once you finish editing the item, press Submit. If you don't need to edit anything, click "Nevermind" to be directed back to the home page.

You will also be able to click a link to delete this food item from the menu or navigate back to the HOME page from this page.

******** WHEN YOU SELECT "Add A Party" ********

From the home page, select "Add a Party," (Note: any open parties will be displayed here.) To add a new party, click "Add A New Party."

This will bring you to a page to input party details (i.e Party Name, Size of Party, etc.). Once the details are in, click "Add This Party." This party will then be listed on the Party page. Employees can click on a party name and begin their order.

When you have clicked on a party name, the order page will appear (with the party details listed at the top, to ensure you are on the correct page. If you notice that any of the details have changed or are incorrect, simply press the "Edit this Party" button). The Menu Items are listed on the left. Once the customer has ordered, click the item and it will appear in the box to the right. To delete an order, click the "X" button in the "(Party Name) Order" box. 

When the party is ready to pay, click "Print Receipt" and print the receipt. 

Once the party has paid, click "This party has paid" button on the bottom. This will change the "Has Paid?" status at the top of the page from false to true. Once it has been changed to true, the party will no longer be able to order items. (If you accidentally push the "This party has paid" button, and the party has not actually paid, just click "Edit this party" and change their status back to false).
